# AJAX-Contact-Form

Created a website contact form that submits the form data using AJAX. Used jQuery to help simplify the JavaScript code and a simple PHP mailer script to handle sending the form data via email.

This script starts by checking that the request was sent using the POST method. If it wasnâ€™t, the script will return a 403 (forbidden) HTTP status code and an error message.
